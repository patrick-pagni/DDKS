# ddKS - a d-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test

This is a fork of the pnnl/ddks repo. The intention of the fork is to add a class which compares an empirical CDF and an analytic CDF. It is in the adKS file and is largely an extension of the DDKS file.

Thanks to Hagen et al. for development of the original ddKS repository which inspired this change.

This code accompanies our paper submitted to IEEE Transactions on
Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence titled "Accelerated Computation of a
High Dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distance" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13706)).  

As of 6/25/2021 there are 3 methods implemented:

* ddKS - d-dimensional KS test caclulated per
    * Variable splitting of space (all points, subsample, grid spacing)
* rdKS - ddKS approximation using distance from (d+1) corners
* vdKS - ddKS approximation calculating ddks distance between voxels instead of points



# Quickstart

Installation of `ddks` should be pretty easy, simple run

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/patrick-pagni/DDKS
```

or, if you want to develop on DDKS, simply clone this repository into a safe
spot on your computer and run

```bash
pip install -e .
```

from the top level of the repository.

Then, you can get started used the
repository by starting a `ddks` object and performing the distance calculation
on any pair of torch tensors that are `sample_size` x `dimension`.

```python
import torch
import ddks

p = torch.rand((100, 3))
t = torch.rand((50, 3))

calculation = ddks.methods.ddKS()
distance = calculation(p, t)
print(f"The ddKS distance is {distance}")
```

To operate on GPU, all you need to do is move the tensors to the device before
calculation:

```python
p = torch.rand((100, 3)).to('cuda:0')
t = torch.rand((50, 3)).to('cuda:0')

calculation = ddks.methods.ddKS()
distance = calculation(p, t)
```

If you want to use a different accelerated method, simply use
`ddks.methods.rdKS` or `ddks.methods.vdKS`. Note that rdKS and vdKS cannot use
GPU.
